## 🎓 Key Insights

### Investment Strategy:
- **Theme:** AI infrastructure vertical integration (chips → cloud → applications → power)
- **Execution:** Options leverage + long holding periods + profit-taking discipline
- **Positioning:** 67.7% tech, defensive income shield (AB), speculative bets (VST, TEM)

### Controversies:
- Microsoft sale before FTC probe (July 2024)
- Visa sale before DOJ lawsuit (2024)
- Tempus AI +35% spike after disclosure (market manipulation concerns)
- No hedges despite high concentration risk

### Performance:
- **Long-term (2014-2026):** +180% vs. S&P 500 +255% (underperformed)
- **Recent (2024-2025):** +54% and +20% vs. S&P 500 +25% and +16% (outperformed)
- **Win rate:** 87.7% (57 of 63 winning trades)

### Verdict:
**Legally compliant, ethically questionable, strategically sophisticated**

The portfolio demonstrates professional-level execution with an AI infrastructure theme, but the timing of certain trades raises legitimate questions about access to non-public policy information. The current system (STOCK Act) allows this activity while damaging public trust.
