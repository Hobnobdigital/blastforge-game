Hi Adam,

I put together a comprehensive shopping guide for lululemon men's apparel and wanted to share it with you. There are some FANTASTIC deals happening right now that I think you'll want to check out.

🔥 HIGHLIGHTS:

✅ City Sweat Crew Neck - ON SALE for $59 (reg $118) - That's 50% OFF!
   This is their signature sweatshirt in soft French terry fabric. Size Large available.
   🛒 Shop: https://shop.lululemon.com/c/men-city-sweat-hoodies-and-sweatshirts/n1dvp0zw1md

✅ Classic Ball Cap (Bone/White) - $38
   Perfect everyday cap with cotton twill and mesh sweatband.
   🛒 Shop: https://shop.lululemon.com/p/hats/Ball-Cap-Wordmark/_/prod11700328

✅ Steady State Crew - Sale $69-89 (reg $118)
   My top recommendation for comfort + value. Relaxed fit, sustainable materials.
   🛒 Shop: https://shop.lululemon.com/p/mens-jackets-and-hoodies-hoodies/Steady-State-Crew/_/prod11520172

💰 TOTAL PACKAGE: ~$170 (Save $135+)

I've attached a detailed shopping guide (HTML file - just open it in your browser) that includes:
• Complete product details and features
• My personal recommendations and why each item is worth it
• Style tips and color strategies
• Direct purchase links for everything
• Size guidance (Size Large = chest 38-40")
• Pros/cons comparison of all options

⚠️ IMPORTANT: 

The City Sweat Crew is in their "We Made Too Much" section, which means:
- Final sale (no returns/exchanges)
- Limited stock - these sell out FAST in popular sizes
- Usually gone within 1-2 weeks

My Recommendation:
If you're interested, I'd grab the City Sweat Crew ASAP before size Large sells out. The 50% discount is rare for this style. The Steady State Crew and ball cap are great additions that'll round out your casual wardrobe.

The attached guide has beautiful formatting with all the details, comparison tables, and styling suggestions. Just double-click to open it in your browser.

Let me know if you have any questions or want more info on any of the items!

Best,
Taylor
