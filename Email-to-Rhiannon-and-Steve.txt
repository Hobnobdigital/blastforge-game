Subject: Recruitment Swag Proposal - $10K Budget Allocation

Hi Rhiannon and Steve,

I've put together a comprehensive proposal for recruitment event swag that maximizes our $10,000 CAD budget while staying on-brand for BCEHS.

SUMMARY:
We've identified high-retention items that potential recruits will actually keep and use daily, sourced from local Vancouver vendors where possible to ensure fast turnaround.

BUDGET BREAKDOWN:
• Custom First Aid Kits (Navy): 600 units @ $6.00 = $3,600
• CPR Face Shield Keychains: 1,000 units @ $2.50 = $2,500
• Ambulance Stress Balls: 750 units @ $2.65 = $1,987
• Soft-Touch Metal Pens (Navy): 1,000 units @ $1.65 = $1,650
• Latex Balloons (Navy): 500 units @ $0.45 = $225
• Shipping/Setup Buffer: ~$500
---
TOTAL: ~$10,462

WHY THESE ITEMS:
1. First Aid Kits - The most "on-brand" item possible. Recruits will keep these in their cars/bags for years.
2. CPR Keychains - Signals "preparedness" and filters for serious candidates. Immediate attachment to keys = high retention.
3. Ambulance Stress Balls - Fun, unique, draws booth attention.
4. Premium Pens - Avoided cheap plastic. These feel professional and get used daily.

VENDORS (LOCAL PRIORITY):
• Coastal Reign (Vancouver) - Free shipping, local pickup available
• Promosapien (Vancouver) - High-end corporate swag
• Emeready (Canada) - CPR/First Aid specialist
• Everything Branded (Canada) - Specialty shapes

TIMELINE:
• Standard production: 10-15 business days
• Rush available: 5-7 days (15-20% surcharge)
• Local pickup option available

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review the attached detailed proposal
2. Confirm quantity preferences (we can adjust the mix)
3. Provide the BCEHS logo vector file (.EPS or .AI - white version)
4. Approve vendor selection
5. Set delivery deadline based on first event date

I've attached the full proposal with vendor links, pricing tiers, and alternative budget scenarios if we need to stay strictly under $10K.

Happy to discuss or adjust based on your feedback!
