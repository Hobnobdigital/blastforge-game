| **March 19** | FOMC meeting | Adjust if Fed surprises |
| **April 1-30** | Q1 earnings season | Biggest catalyst period |
| **May 1** | Begin profit-taking on big winners (>15% gains) | Lock in gains early |
| **May 20-31** | Final exit window | Don't overstay - "sell in May" |

## ⚠️ KEY RISKS (What Could Go Wrong)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Hedge |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Market correction** | 30% | -10 to -20% | Stop losses, cash reserve |

**Risk of hitting 20% target: <15%**  
**Risk of underperforming cash (0%): ~25-30%**

## 🎲 IF YOU INSIST ON 20% (High Risk Alternative)

**This is gambling. You've been warned.**

### Aggressive Adjustments:
1. **Cut cash to 0%** - fully invested
2. **Increase BAC to 12%** (from 7%)
3. **Increase IWN to 15%** (from 10%)
4. **Add 10% momentum stocks** (APLD, SOFI, or similar high-beta)
5. **Cut defensive plays** (CLX, PEP to 5% each)
6. **Expected beta: 1.3-1.5**

**Downside:** Could lose 20-25% in a correction  
**Probability of 20% gain:** ~20-25%  
**Probability of 0-10% gain:** ~50%  
**Probability of loss:** ~25-30%

## 📈 MARKET CONTEXT (Why This Is Hard)

### Current State:
- ✅ S&P 500 at all-time highs (~7,000)
- ❌ P/E ratios at 27-30x (expensive)
- ❌ VIX at 16.85 (complacent)
- ⚠️ Already up 15.62% vs. last year (gains front-loaded)
- ⚠️ Fed on pause, inflation at 2.9% (above target)

### Expert Forecasts for FULL YEAR 2026:
- Optimistic: 15% (Oppenheimer)
- Average: 9-10% (consensus)
- Conservative: 3-5% (bears)

**You're asking for more in 4 months than most expect in 12.**

## 🧠 MENTAL MODELS FOR SUCCESS

### What To Do:
✅ Think in probabilities, not certainties  
✅ Accept that 10% in 4 months is excellent  
✅ Take partial profits at +15% (lock in wins)  
✅ Cut losses fast (stops exist for a reason)  
✅ Focus on not losing vs. winning big  

### What NOT To Do:
❌ Average down on losers (no "catching falling knives")  
❌ Move stops lower (discipline > hope)  
❌ Add to positions after 10%+ gains (don't chase)  
❌ Check portfolio every hour (noise ≠ signal)  
❌ Panic sell on 3-5% dips (volatility is normal)
