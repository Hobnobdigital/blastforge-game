## BLASTFORGE Bomberman Game Development

### Major Progress Today
- **Fixed Level Selection**: All levels now unlocked for testing
- **Camera Improvements**: Switched between orthographic and perspective multiple times to find best view
- **Character Scaling**: Increased player and enemy sizes 3x for better visibility
- **Bomb Visibility**: Increased bomb size and pulse effect
- **Audio System**: Confirmed all SFX files exist and are connected (bomb place, explosion, power-up, victory/defeat)
- **Movement Fix**: Fixed bug where players couldn't move after placing bomb
- **Game Loop**: Fixed missing game.start() call that prevented game from running

### Current Status (End of Day)
- Game is playable at https://bomberman-game-navy.vercel.app
- All 7 levels unlocked
- 3D perspective camera showing full 13x13 board
- Characters are much bigger and visible
- Sound effects working (bomb place, explosion)
- Enemies present and active
- Victory/defeat screens working
- Themes (Miami Beach, Ice World) integrated but visibility still being debugged

### User Feedback Patterns
- Wants "10/10" quality, not "1/10"
- Emphasizes visibility and playability
- Wants themes (Miami Beach, etc.) to be clearly visible
- Expects sound effects for all actions
- Wants levels unlocked for testing
- Uses mobile/touch controls

### Technical Debt
- Theme rendering still needs verification
- UI polish (glassmorphism) partially implemented
- Audio files exist but may need ElevenLabs regeneration for higher quality
- Some debug logging still in code
