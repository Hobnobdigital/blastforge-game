Section 1

Hard Requirements (Non-Negotiables)
The following requirements are absolute and must be satisfied for the project to be considered complete.
• Web App: The game is a web app that runs smoothly in modern browsers (desktop first; mobile
optional but plan for it).
• 3D + Grid: It is 3D with a grid-based rule set (Bomberman-style logic), but must remain visually
readable at all times.
• Original Twist: Must include an original twist that adds mastery without breaking the core loop.
• Ship Quality: Must ship with: polished UI/UX (menus, settings, tutorial), professional SFX +
soundtrack, high-quality visuals (3D assets, VFX, lighting), and robust testing for deterministic
gameplay.
• Asset Pipeline: You must use an asset pipeline: source licensed assets OR generate originals using
generative AI integrations; track prompts/settings/versions for every generated asset; ensure
legal/IP-safe originality (no Bomberman characters, names, logos, silhouettes).

Section 2

Product Definition You Must Deliver First
Produce a concise design package before building anything. This section defines the three core
deliverables.

A) One-Page Concept
• Game name (original)
• Target player (who it's for)
• Core fantasy (what the player feels)
• Core loop (30-second summary)
• Twist (one sentence)
• Key differentiator (why this beats "another Bomberman clone")

B) Pillars (3–5)
For each pillar, define:
• Player benefit
• How it shows up in gameplay
• How we measure it (e.g., rematch rate, session time, "fair death" perception)

Page 10 of 10

C) MVP vs “Delight”
• MVP: the minimum set to ship a great game
• Delight: upgrades that make it a 10/10 (visual polish, audio depth, extra maps, ranked, etc.)
Acceptance Criteria
✓ Your concept must explicitly protect fairness/readability in 3D
✓ The twist must include counterplay and clear telegraphs

Section 3

Twist Selection Requirements
Choose one twist direction and implement it deeply:

Option 1: Vertical Multi-Layer Arenas (2–3 layers)
– Clear transitions (ramps/lifts)
– Explosions affect other layers only through explicit vents/shafts that are telegraphed

Option 2: Fuse Manipulation Mind-Games
– Limited "prime/shorten/remote detonate"
– Strong telegraphs so opponents can read threat timing

Option 3: Material-Based Blast Behavior (Deterministic)
– Tile materials that alter propagation in predictable ways (no chaotic physics)

Acceptance Criteria
✓ Must preserve the classic loop: destroy soft blocks → power-ups → territory control → trapping
✓ Must produce at least 10 "interaction tiles" (gadgets/hazards/materials) that create memorable plays
✓ Must include 3 example "pro plays" enabled by the twist

Section 4

Gameplay Systems (Must Be Deterministic and
Testable)
A) Grid & Movement
• Movement is grid-aligned (snap-to-tile) with consistent collision rules
• No slippery or ambiguous cornering

Page 10 of 10

3D Bomberman-Inspired Web App — LLM Agent Instructions

• Every tile state is deterministic (same inputs → same outcomes)

B) Bomb Rules
• Orthogonal "cross" propagation
• Hard blocks stop blasts; soft blocks break and can reveal drops
• Chain reactions supported
• Fuse timing must be readable and consistent

C) Power-Ups
Minimum set:
• +Bomb Count
• +Blast Range
• +Speed
• +2 twist-related power-ups (original)
Define:
• Drop rules (rarity, where they spawn)
• Whether they can be destroyed by explosions
• Stacking rules and caps
Acceptance Criteria
✓ Provide unit tests for explosion propagation and tile outcomes
✓ Provide simulation/replay logging so issues can be reproduced exactly
✓ 8-player chaos must still be readable

Section 5

Web Tech Architecture Requirements
You must propose and implement a web stack that supports a premium 3D game.

Core Requirements
• 3D rendering: WebGL-based (engine/framework you choose)
• Game loop: fixed timestep simulation for determinism
• Input: keyboard/controller support; responsive input buffering
• Audio: real-time mixing with separate volume sliders (Music/SFX/UI)
• State: clean separation between simulation state and render state

Must-Have Engineering Features

Page 10 of 10

3D Bomberman-Inspired Web App — LLM Agent Instructions

• Deterministic seed support (for maps/drops if randomized)
• Replay/event log recorder
• Performance profiling plan (FPS targets, budget per frame)
• Accessible settings: motion reduction options, flash intensity option, colorblind-friendly indicators (or at
least strong contrast)
Acceptance Criteria
✓ Document why you chose your engine/framework and how it meets performance + determinism
✓ The game must maintain stable frame pacing under stress (many explosions)

Section 6

Camera and Readability Rules (Critical in 3D)
Camera Requirements
• Default camera: high angled top-down 3D (isometric-ish), optimized for readability
• Player must see enough of the arena to avoid "cheap deaths"
• No essential hazard should occur offscreen without warning

VFX Requirements
• Explosions must look incredible but never obscure tile readability
• VFX must scale down intelligently in heavy scenes
Acceptance Criteria
✓ Provide a "clarity under stress" test scenario: max explosions + max players
✓ Provide a UX checklist proving players can predict danger tiles correctly

Section 7

Art Direction (Original IP, AAA Polish)
You must create an original art direction.

Deliverables
Style Bible
• Palette
• Lighting mood

Page 10 of 10

3D Bomberman-Inspired Web App — LLM Agent Instructions

• Materials rules
• Shape language (how props/characters look)
• UI style (icons, fonts, spacing rules)

Asset List
• Tiles (hard, soft, special)
• Bombs (variants if any)
• Explosions/VFX

• Menus and HUD
Acceptance Criteria
✓ A new player can instantly distinguish: walkable vs blocked, hard vs soft blocks, bombs + fuse state,
pickups + rarity tier
✓ No direct imitation of Bomberman identity cues (characters, names, signature look)

Section 8

Generative AI Asset Pipeline
You must create a pipeline that can:
• 1. Generate or source concept art for environments, props, UI
• 2. Produce consistent iconography (power-ups, UI)
• 3. Produce textures/materials (or stylized equivalents)
• 4. Produce audio drafts (SFX and/or music) OR source from licensed libraries
• 5. Auto-organize all assets into repo structure with naming conventions

Mandatory Metadata for Every Generated Asset
• Prompt text
• Negative prompt (if used)
• Seed/settings (if supported)
• Version id / timestamp
• Tool/model used
• License/terms note or source attribution
• Export formats

Consistency Enforcement
• Build prompt templates that enforce the style bible

Page 10 of 10

3D Bomberman-Inspired Web App — LLM Agent Instructions

• Implement a "style consistency check" (your method) so icons and UI assets match
Acceptance Criteria
✓ Random sample of 30 UI icons: at least 90% look like one coherent set
✓ Asset repo must be clean, searchable, and reproducible (regenerate if needed)

Section 9

Audio: SFX + Soundtrack Must Feel Premium
Deliverables
• SFX list: every action has a sound — place bomb, fuse tick, pickup, hit, win/lose, UI

Music Plan
• Menu theme
• Gameplay themes (calm → intense escalation)
• Stingers (victory/defeat)

Mixing Requirements
• Volume sliders: Master, Music, SFX, UI
• Spatial audio for hazards (directional cues)
Acceptance Criteria
✓ Provide an audio "readability test": players can locate threats by sound direction
✓ Provide a "mix pass" checklist so explosions don't drown UI feedback

Section 10

Game Modes and Retention Design
Must Ship With
• Core Arena Mode (local vs bots minimum; online optional if time allows)
• Party Mode modifiers (short, chaotic variants)
• Solo Challenge (puzzle rooms or roguelite tower)

Retention System (Non-Pay-to-Win)
• Unlock cosmetics via play (not power)

Page 10 of 10

3D Bomberman-Inspired Web App — LLM Agent Instructions

• Mastery challenges that teach advanced play
• Tutorial under 3 minutes that teaches: trapping basics, chain reactions, the twist mechanics
Acceptance Criteria
✓ Track at least: session length, rematch rate, rage-quit rate, tutorial completion rate
✓ Player deaths should feel "outplayed" not "unfair/offscreen"

Section 11

Online Multiplayer (Optional but If Included, Must Be
Real)
If you include online multiplayer:
• Choose a netcode approach and justify it (authoritative vs peer)
• Must handle latency gracefully and avoid "teleport deaths"
• Must include basic anti-cheat assumptions (server-authoritative logic helps)
Acceptance Criteria
✓ Test scenario: 150ms latency still feels playable and fair
✓ Deterministic server validation of bomb/explosion outcomes

Section 12

QA and Testing
Required Automated Tests
• Explosion propagation correctness
• Tile state transitions (soft block destroyed, power-up spawn, chain reaction)
• Movement/collision determinism
• Map validation rules (spawn safety, reachable zones)

Debug Tooling
