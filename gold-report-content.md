## Page 4: Defining Gold Investment
**Main Content:**
Each investor's approach to gold varies. For some, it represents the ultimate store of value and hedge against uncertainty. For others, it centers around specific factors, like portfolio diversification or protection against currency debasement.

For the purposes of this analysis, "gold investment" is defined by three core elements. The balance of these three elements makes up the core of building wealth and preserving capital.

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Physical Security** - Holding tangible assets that maintain value independent of counterparty risk and government policy
2. **Financial Protection** - Safeguarding wealth against inflation, currency weakness, and market volatility
3. **Portfolio Diversification** - Allocating to an asset with low correlation to traditional stocks and bonds

**Left Column:**
Investors are increasingly recognizing gold as essential for portfolio protection—yet many remain underexposed.

Central banks, institutions, and retail investors have demonstrated this through record-breaking purchases, driving gold to over 50 all-time highs in 2025.
