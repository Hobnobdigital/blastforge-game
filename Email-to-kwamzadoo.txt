Subject: BCEHS Recruitment Swag Proposal - $10K Budget

Hi,

Please find attached the comprehensive swag proposal for BC Emergency Health Services recruitment events.

SYNOPSIS:

I've researched and compiled a strategic allocation of our $10,000 CAD budget across high-retention promotional items that align with BCEHS branding. The proposal prioritizes:

✅ LOCAL VANCOUVER VENDORS (Coastal Reign, Promosapien) for fast turnaround
✅ ON-BRAND ITEMS that potential recruits will actually keep and use
✅ BULK PRICING optimization to maximize quantity and impact

BUDGET SUMMARY:
• Custom First Aid Kits (Navy): 600 units @ $6.00 = $3,600
• CPR Face Shield Keychains: 1,000 units @ $2.50 = $2,500
• Ambulance Stress Balls: 750 units @ $2.65 = $1,987
• Soft-Touch Metal Pens (Navy): 1,000 units @ $1.65 = $1,650
• Latex Balloons (Navy): 500 units @ $0.45 = $225
• Shipping/Setup Buffer: ~$500
---
TOTAL: ~$10,462

WHY THESE ITEMS:

1. **First Aid Kits** - Most "on-brand" item possible. High perceived value, kept for years.
2. **CPR Keychains** - Signals preparedness, filters for serious candidates. Immediate key attachment = retention.
3. **Ambulance Stress Balls** - Fun, unique, draws booth attention.
4. **Premium Pens** - Professional feel, daily use. Avoided cheap plastic.
5. **Balloons** - Cost-effective visual presence at events.
